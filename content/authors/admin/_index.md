Dr. Darren Yeo joined the Division of Psychology at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in July 2021. He obtained a Ph.D. in Neuroscience and an M.Ed. in Child Studies from Vanderbilt University, USA. He was trained as a primary school teacher at the National Institute of Education, Singapore, and have taught for a couple of years in an MOE school and other educational settings.\
\
He uses behavioural and neuroimaging methods to investigate how children and adults learn and think about numerical and mathematical symbols, concepts and skills, as well as how and why individuals differ in their learning and competencies. In another line of work, he studies the relative effectiveness of various learning and instructional strategies (e.g., retrieval practice and use of worked examples) to inform how individual and classroom learning can be better structured to make knowledge stick.
